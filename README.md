# Park Rangers - Back End Project 

This site is fully functional and can be seen using [this link](https://park-rangers-project.herokuapp.com).

This site was created to provide the user the ability to create a trip involving visits to National Parks in the United States. 

## Welcome Page

The user is brought first to the home page.

If the user clicks on the "Create A Trip" button, they will be brought to the login page. They can log in if they already have an account, or they can click on the link to register.

The user needs to enter all information in order to create an account. If the username is already in use, the page will inform the user. 

If the user is successful in creating an account, they will be brought to the login page to login with their new credentials.

Once the user logs in, they are brough to the Explore page where they can start planning their trip! They provide a trip name, region and state they'd like to explore, and dates of the trip.

Once the user clicks "Explore" button, the parks in the region and state they selected are populated to the page.



*This site was originally built while working in a group in my bootcamp! I cloned the repo and added a few personal touches to it! If you'd like to see the original, please visit [this page](https://github.com/mjbulostin/ParkRangers).*
